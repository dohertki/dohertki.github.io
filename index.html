         Marvel Comics are a cultural phenomenon. Creations like Iron Man, Spider-man, and the Hulk are among the most recognizable characters on the planet Marvel has invaded every form of media whether it be video games, television, the big screen, and of course we can't forget print. In fact Marvel has been printing comics since 1939 and Marvel's database lists almost 40,000 issues. If you want indulge your inner-geekdom that database is available to the public.  But, to access it you need need to know how to use their API and thats what we are going to explore.

          <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-xs-12" >
    <p>The first thing that you will need to visit the <a href="https://developer.marvel.com/" target="_blank">Mavel Developer Website</a>. Here you will be able to set up a developer 
     account.  Once you have an account set up go to the blank page. There are two keys here:
     a private key and a public key. Write both keys down because you will need them to authenticate api calls.

    <h1>Where to use your API keys.</h1>
    <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-xs-12" >
          <p>Now that you have your API keys, what do you with them? Well when your aplication makes an API call you will need to include them as part of your request. In addtion you will need to include hash that is built from a string made by combining the time stamp + the private key + the public key. This string is then encryted by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5" target="_blank">md5 algorithm</a>. A word of caution, the order the string is very specific. In addition not all md5 algorithms will produce the same hash key. You may need to try several different sources of the md5 algorithm to find one that the server is happy with.

          <p>The means that your application will use to communicate with Marvel's servers is through the HTTP method GET. A GET request sends information from one computer by appending the information to the end of the requested destinations  url. This is called the query string and it starts after '?' in above example: 
          <ul>
            <li>'ts=1' is the timestap value. </li>
            <li>'apikey=1234' is the public key value.</li>
            <li>'hash=ffd2***' is the hash value.</li>

          </ul>

      <h1>Making an AJAX request </h1>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-xs-12" >
         Ajax is widely used by web applications to receive information from servers asynchronously. Web applications use the Ajax XMLHttpRequest() to create an XMLHttpRequest object. The object is both responsible for sending the request and receiving the response. The XMLHttpRequest object's 'open' procedure prepares the message and takes three arguments: the method(GET, POST, etc), the target servers url, and a true/false argument for asynchronous operation. The JavaScript implement ion is as follows:
         <div class="jumbotron">
           <p>
          var req = new XMLHttpRequest();<br>
          req.open('GET', url, true);<br>
          req.send(null);
          </p>

    <h1>Get the Response in JSON</h1>
    <p>     Marvel's comics are a cultural phenomeon. The Marvel API gives one access to Marvel's vast database of information of
        everything comic related. Marvel's public accessible API operations are broadly
        divided up into Characters, Comics(single issues), Creators, Events(the larger
        storyline), Series(comics of the same title and volume) and Stories( a story told
        in one issue). These operations are called entities. Within each entity are
        attributes which are JSON keys and their associated values.
